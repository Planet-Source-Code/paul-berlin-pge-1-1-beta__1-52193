## PGE 1\.1 beta


</div>

### Description

PGE (Pab Game Engine) is my game engine for Visual Basic. It's using DirectX for graphics and FMOD for sound. It requires an 3D accelerated T&L graphics card. I have used it for some of the other programs you'll find on my webpage. This version is just a beta version. However almost everything is finished already, there are just some bugs to fix and minor features to add. If anyone want to finish or enhance PGE you are welcome to. Send me the final version and I'll put it on my webpage.

Included are also two tools for PGE, PgeSound and PgeTiles. You can use these two program to compile sounds, music, textures and sprites into single files.
